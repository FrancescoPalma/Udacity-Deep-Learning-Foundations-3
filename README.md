# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Foundations
**Project 3**
  
*INTRO*: In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern. 
  
*SOLUTION*: The solution - with code and detailed comments - is available as HTML file to run in any browser and/or as Jupyter Notebook.
